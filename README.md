# Impromptu

A domain-specific language for prompt engineering

Impromptu is a prototype implementation of a model-driven engineering tool for prompt engineering. Its goal is enabling the definition of prompts for different types of generative AI systems and different tasks (text-to-text, text-to-image, multi-modal prompts). 

## Requirements

Impromptu is implemented in TypeScript using the Langium open-source language engineering toolkit.

## Installing

Impromptu is offered as a Visual Studio Code extension.

## Features 

At this stage, the features offered by Impromptu are limited. The extension offers an editor for impromptu prompts, with syntax highlighting, syntax validation and autocomplete suggestions. Moreover, there is a command-line interface to generate prompts for specific AI systems (right now, Midjourney and Stable Diffusion).
